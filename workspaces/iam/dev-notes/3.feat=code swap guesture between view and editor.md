## requirement
* swipe in code fence on mobile can switch to editor of the touched line (focused)

## obstacles
* code in code fence is special, only the parent of the code has data-lines attribute
* swipe action could not be detected by viewer.

## solution
1. add pointer-event:none to code's parent, so the swipe action could be detected by viewer.
1. replace all text nodes from Prism highlight with span, so it could be detected with document.ElementFromPoint.
1. set the lineNumber on span by counting the '\n' chars.
1. inside swipe handler of viewer, disable pointer-event to find span with the document.ElementFromPoint and then enable it to trigger swipe on viewer next time.
1. if swipe at the blank area, not on span, we need to find the nearest span from the action start point, using getBoundingClientArea.
1. find parent that have data-lines attribute and add lineNumber of span to get the lineNumber in editor.
