## plan
1. [X] get original code from prism.js output: remove the span tags and concat the content, good: `codeElement.textContent`
1. [X] a 'run' button in code-fence toolbar to trigger
1. [X] run script: code is run in temp cope, code still can access global scope, use `this` to share data between scripts.
1. a console panel to show logs
1. intercept console api to show logs

```js
const scopedEval = (scope, script) => Function(`"use strict"; ${script}`).bind(scope)();
scopedEval({a:1,b:2},"return this.a+this.b")
```
