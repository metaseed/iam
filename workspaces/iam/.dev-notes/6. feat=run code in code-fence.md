## plan
1. [X] get original code from prism.js output: remove the span tags and concat the content, good: `codeElement.textContent`
1. [X] a 'run' button in code-fence toolbar to trigger
1. [X] run script: code is run in temp cope, code still can access global scope, use `this` to share data between scripts.
1. [X] a console panel to show logs
1. [X] intercept console api to show logs

my answer on stack-overflow about how to provide scope for script eval
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9781285/specify-scope-for-eval-in-javascript/72059175#answer-72059175

code is inside script-run.ts

## new requirement May 5, 2022

> use functions or variables defined in previous executed scripts.

### solution
a `scope` obj in global scope, that merge var or func to scriptsScope.

```js
const operations = {
  // actions only take effects on next script execution.
  scope: {
    set(obj: Object) {
      scriptsScope = { ...scriptsScope, ...obj };
    },
    clear() {
      scriptsScope = { ...defaultScriptsScope };
    }
  },
};
```
> need to explicitly call scope.set({a,b,func});

## automatically store local defined variable in the document scripts scope
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2051678/getting-all-variables-in-scope
not use it, because the 'with' solution, can not share let, const and function
