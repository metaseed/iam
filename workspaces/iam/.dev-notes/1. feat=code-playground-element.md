## investigation: how to integrate web-component as markdown-it plugin
requirement: 
* lazy-load: only when use do loading


## solutions
### load from unpkg (work)
> bad: too many small files downloading
```ts
export function loadModuleScript(src){
  const script = document.body.querySelector('script[src="'+src+'"]')
  if(script) return script;

  let dyn = document.createElement("script")
  dyn.type = "module"
  dyn.src= src;
  document.body.appendChild(dyn)
}
```
```ts
loadModuleScript("https://unpkg.com/playground-elements?module");
```
### dynamic module, the preferred way
```ts
     // b5054c5318212ffd.js:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined
      (async () => {
        await import(
          // https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#magic-comments 
          // not all below comments not work!
          /* webpackChunkName: "code-playground" */
          /* webpackMode: "lazy" */
          /* webpackPrefetch: true */
          /* webpackPreload: true */
          "/playground");
      })()
```
playground.js
```js
import "playground-elements";
```
complain: Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined

modify package.json by adding type: module, so make the project module use esmodule
and also use https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-builders/custom-webpack, to add custom webpack config,
it would generate esmodule so no required. but it would try to load local resource

> error: Not allowed to load local resource: file:///M:/Workspace/i'm/node_modules/playground-elements/playground-typescript-worker.js

custom-webpack-config.cjs
```js
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    playground: './playground.js',
},
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/playground.html',
      filename: 'playground.html',
    }),


    // Add your plugins here
    // Learn more about plugins from https://webpack.js.org/configuration/plugins/
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\\playground.(js|jsx)$/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
      },
      {
        test: /playground-typescript-worker\.js$/,
        use: { loader: "worker-loader" },
      },
    ]
    }
};
```

even though according https://github.com/google/playground-elements#bundling
it says, no special config needed for webpack.
and I also tried to copy playground-typescript-worker.js to the root folder, also not work. put to /playground-elements also not work.
```json
              {
                "glob": "playground-typescript-worker.js",
                "input": "../../node_modules/playground-elements",
                "output": "/"
              },
```

> I event tried to use worker-loader and install latest webpack.

one way that work, is download the webpack example, and generate the production build and use it as a local package

search import.meta.url in angular-cli and webpack
https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22620

currently webpack and angular cli has problem for Worker, so wait an use temp solution: build local version
